# Digit Creation with GANs
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) were developed by Ian J. Goodfellow in 2014. They can be used to generate complex colour images such as faces. Images created by GANs can look so real that it is practically impossible to distinguish between real and fake images. However, generating complex images of these level of realism requires a large amount of resources to train the network.

### GAN - General Adversarial Network
In a GAN two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator are trained simultaneously by an adversarial process. The generator (artist) learns to create images that look real. The discriminator (critic) learns to detect fake images. The two competing models try to beat each other. The goal is to train the generator to outperform the discriminator.

## How does GAN work?
Training a GAN consists of two parts:
1.	While the generator remains idle, the discriminator is trained on real images for a number of epochs to see if it can correctly predict them as real. In the same phase the discriminator is trained on fake images to (generated by the generator) to see if it can predict them as fake.
2.	While the discriminator is idle, train the generator and use the results from the discriminator to improve the images.
These steps are repeated for a large number of epochs. The results (fake images) are examined manually to determine if they look real. If they look real the training is stopped. If not the preceding two steps are repeated until the fake images appears real. This process is depicted in **Figure 1**.
